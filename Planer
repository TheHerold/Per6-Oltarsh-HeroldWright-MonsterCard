Plan:
basic structure:
Turn based card game, so, decks, cards, and a turn by turn sequence.
Each turn has a draw card, then a optional place card, 
then an optional attack (inbuilt defence?), then it moves on to the nextplayer/ai(?)
-------------------------
Turn:
clicking runs a DrawCard function, which moves a card to the hand. (using a processing mouse clicked event)

clicking on a card plays it (Need part of board designated hand) 

clicking on a card played causes it to attack the card in front (above) of it (This should be easier then having 
it attack selected monster) 

clicking an end button causes it to go to the other side.
--------------------------------------
Board:
Four "zones" (different colored backgrounds I assume)
Goes: 

Hand-Player1Side-Player2Side-Hand
(   )---|---(   )
(   )---|---(   )
(   )---|---(   )
(   )---|---(   )

cards pulled from off screen, (Need list of card images, to load in to processing)
cards placed on hand (follow mouse until clicked)
Board static otherwise
------------------------------------
Monsters with good attack
Monsters with good defense
Boss cards, rare
